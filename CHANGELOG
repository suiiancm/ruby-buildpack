v1.0.0 Jun 17, 2014
===================

* Remove libyaml 0.1.5. It's not used and has a security flaw.

* Modify [the Heroku Ruby buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby) to
  support offline mode.

* Do not download Heroku's pre-cached gems. They are not binary compatible
  with the Cloud Foundry environment.
