# Scripts to obtain binaries for the manfiest

These scripts are intended to be run from the buildpack root. E.g:

```
./cf_build/copy ruby-2.2.2 
```

## prerequisites
To upload these to the cloud foundry repository for buildpack dependencies, you must have access to this repository.
If you want to use these scripts for your own dependencies, you will need to provide your own s3 bucket and credentials.
